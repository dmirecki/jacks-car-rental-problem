# Jack's Car Rental Problem Solution

The repository is my solution to the exercise 4.7 from the book
**Reinforcement Learning - An Introduction** by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.
The repository contains code that solves Jack's Car Rental Problem (the original problem 
presented in Example 4.2) and modified version of the problem (with some
non-linearities, presented in Exercise 4.7).
